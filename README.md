# Battery Testing

The battery tester software can be downloaded from [West Mountain Radio](https://www.westmountainradio.com/kb_view_topic.php?id=OT39)

## Battery Inventory

The battery inventory is stored on the [Controls Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FuXBKi-0rdc3TUn-NmKlwbxnQNfPKqYTIuXhqqFid90/edit?usp=sharing).
The sheet contains the following columns:

- **Battery Name**: The name of the battery for easy identification on the cart
- **Battery #**: The unique number of the battery in the format of `YYYY-##` where `YYYY` is the year the battery was first used and `##` is the number of the battery in that year
  - Note that we started using this format in 2023, so batteries from before 2023 will start with 2023
- **Batch #**: The batch number of the battery which can be found on the top of the battery
- **####**: Columns named after the year the test was performed with a value of the measured Amp Hour (Ah) of the battery

## Battery Burn-in

From testing, it seems that the first time a battery is used, it may take 2 to 3 tests for a battery to reach its full capacity. This is likely due to the battery needing to be "burned in" before it can reach its full capacity.
